        <h2>Notable Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some highlights from my CV and career achievements: <br> ‚Ä¢ I was born. <br> ‚Ä¢ I learn to drink breast milk. <br> ‚Ä¢ I learn to walk. <br> ‚Ä¢ It was a hard one, but after 8 years of my life, I finally learn how to talk. <br> ‚Ä¢ I learn how to talk again, but now to girls (that's how I met my lovely wife!) <br> ‚Ä¢ I became a child of God (this is actually a good one) <br> ‚Ä¢ I learn the art of dank meme-ing. <br> ‚Ä¢ I built a time machine because I had regret not meeting Kenneth sooner and making him the best man at my wedding, so I built a freaking time machine and then flew back into time and then stalked Kenneth and introduce myself to him and made him the best man at my wedding. <br> <span class = "flipped-text">  I worked at Sandia National Labratories (but who really cares about this point). ‚Ä¢ </span>
