      "content": "<p>The purpose of this post is to provide the full power of what this website can do. It can do a lot of things, including: rendering code blocks, rendering qoutes, writing lists, writing tables, and handling LaTeK support. Let's attempt to do some of these things. All you really need to do is to go <a href ='https://text-html.com/' target = '_blank'>here</a> and start creating your own HTML content and paste it in a code block. Let's see some of the things we can do.</p> <p> First, we can handle code blocks: </p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function greet() { return 'Hello World'; }</code></pre> <p> Now, it can handle some qoutes, here is a quote:</p> <blockquote class = 'blockqoute blockquote--classic'> I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. </blockquote><p> Obviously, this is a website for a math NERD, so we need some LaTeX support. So here are the LaTeX functionalities. Do you know this PDE?!: </p> <p> \\( - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2} + \\nabla^2 \\psi + \\frac{m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2}\\psi = 0\\) </p> <p> If you said yes, I do... then you might be a NERD! HA, you NERD! Okay, next, it can handle some lists: </p> <ol><li> You are a tomato. </li><li> You are a potato. </li> </ol>"
